Go implementation of [The P-Square Algorithm for Dynamic Calculation of Quantiles and Histograms Without Storing Observations][1].

> The algorithm is proposed for dynamic calculation of [..] quantiles. The estimates are produced dynamically as the observations are generated. The observations are not stored, therefore, the algorithm has a very small and fixed storage requirement regardless of the number of observations.
